= OCR and Watermark

This script will take a folder of images and do the following:

# Create a folder with duplicates (so the originals are untouched) in the jpg format (in a 'jpgs' folder).
# Run an OCR program on the file and create a text file with the text.
# Create a copy of the image with a water mark on the bottom.
